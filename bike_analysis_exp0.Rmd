The goal of this analysis is to be able to predict enrollment into MA132 for Spring 2121, using data from several previous semesters.

Prepare workspace:

## Load packages

We will work primarily within the context of the tidyverse set of packages, with a few additional packages supporting exploratory analysis.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(skimr)
library(summarytools)
```

## Data

From that August 2020 file

### Read the data

```{r}
dfa= read_excel("202008-capitalbikeshare-tripdata.xlsx",sheet=2) %>% clean_names()
```

We summarize that dataframe to identify data types, missing data, et cetera.

```{r}
skim(dfa)
```
```{r}
glimpse(dfa)
```
### A histogram

```{r}
dfa %>% filter(duration_min<50,duration_min>1) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=duration_min)) + geom_histogram(bins = 300)+facet_wrap(~dayofweek)
```
